			<ul class="hm-content-noindent">
				<li>Treat the bleeding or other cause of shock.</li>
				<li>Lay her down with her head to one side so she does not choke on vomit.</li>
				<li> Put something under her legs to raise them. Cover her with a blanket or clothes. Help her stay calm.</li>
				<li>If she can drink, give her sips of water or rehydration drink. If she cannot drink, start rectal fluids. Or if you know how, start a fast intravenous drip (IV) with a wide needle.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="clear">If she is unconscious, do not give her anything by mouth - no medicines, drink, or food until she has been awake for one hour.</p>
