				<li>Ask the mother to urinate. A full bladder prevents the womb from contracting.</li>
				<li>Keep the mother lying down and put the baby to her breast. If the baby will not suckle, try rolling the mother's nipples. This will make the womb contract and stop heavy bleeding.</li>
				<li>Firmly rub the top of her womb at the level of her navel until the womb becomes hard. Keep rubbing until heavy bleeding has stopped.</li>
				<li>Give medicine to stop the bleeding. Give 10 units of oxytocin by injection in the buttock or thigh.</li>
				<li>OR give 800 mcg of misoprostol, 1 time only. Dissolve inside the cheek or under the tongue for 30 minutes and then swallow what is left. If the woman cannot swallow, insert tablets in the rectum. Wear a glove.</li>
				<li>OR give 0.2 mg of ergometrine by mouth, or by injection in the thigh.</li>
