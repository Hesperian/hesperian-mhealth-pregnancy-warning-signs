			<h2 class="hm-pagetitle">How to give medicine<br>to stop bleeding</h2>
            Give one of these medicines to stop heavy bleeding after the baby is born:
            <p><span class="hm-content-strong">Oxytocin</span><br>Inject 10 units of oxytocin in the side of the thigh muscle. You can give this dose again in 20 minutes if bleeding does not stop.</p>
			
			<p><span class="hm-content-strong">Misoprostol</span> <br>Dissolve 800 mcg inside the mouth, against the cheek or under the tongue, for about 30 minutes. Then swallow what is left. If she feels nauseous, you can insert tablets into the woman's rectum instead. Wear a glove.</p>

			<p><span class="hm-content-strong">Ergometrine (only give after the placenta has come out)</span> <br>Inject 0.2 mg ergometrine in the side of the thigh muscle.<br> OR, give 0.2 mg of ergometrine pills by mouth. You can give ergometrine every 2 to 4 hours for severe bleeding, or every 6 to 12 hours for less severe bleeding. But continue to give the medicine until bleeding has stopped and the womb is hard, usually about 48 hours. Pills do not work as quickly as injections. <span class="hm-content-strong">Do not give ergometrine to a woman with high blood pressure.</span></p>
